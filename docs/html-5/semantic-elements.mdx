# üôãüèª HTML5 Semantic Elements

HTML5 introduces new semantic elements that provide more meaningful information about the content of a web page. These elements help search engines and screen readers understand the structure of a web page, making it more accessible and SEO-friendly.

Some of the new semantic elements introduced in HTML5 include:

- `<header>`: This element represents a group of introductory or navigational aids, such as a logo, site navigation, or search form.
- `<nav>`: This element represents a section of a page that contains navigation links.
- `<main>`: This element represents the main content of a page.
- `<article>`: This element represents a self-contained piece of content, such as a blog post or news article.
- `<section>`: This element represents a thematic grouping of content, such as a chapter in a book or a section of a web page.
- `<aside>`: This element represents content that is tangentially related to the content around it, such as a sidebar or pull quote.
- `<footer>`: This element represents a group of footer information, such as copyright information, contact details, or site navigation.

By using these new semantic elements, you can create a more structured and accessible web page that is easier for search engines and screen readers to understand.

## Example

Here's an example of how you can use these new semantic elements in an HTML document:

```html title="index.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My First HTML5 Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <header>
        <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
        <nav>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
                <li><a href="#">About</a></li>
                <li><a href="#">Contact</a></li>
            </ul>
        </nav>
    </header>
    <main>
        <article>
            <h2>My First Blog Post</h2>
            <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.</p>
        </article>
        <section>
            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.</p>
        </section>
        <aside>
            <h3>Related Links</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="#">Link 1</a></li>
                <li><a href="#">Link 2</a></li>
                <li><a href="#">Link 3</a></li>
            </ul>
        </aside>
    </main>
    <footer>
        <p>&copy; 2021 My Website. All rights reserved.</p>
    </footer>
</body>
</html>
```

<BrowserWindow url="http://.../index.html">
  <MyFirstHTML5Page />
</BrowserWindow>

In this example, we've used the `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<aside>`, and `<footer>` elements to create a structured web page with meaningful content.

By using these new semantic elements, you can improve the accessibility and SEO-friendliness of your web pages, making them easier for search engines and screen readers to understand.

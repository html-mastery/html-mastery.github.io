# üôãüèª HTML Quotation and Citation Elements

HTML quotation and citation elements are used to mark up quotations and citations in a document. They allow you to specify the source of the quoted text and provide additional information about the quoted text.

In this tutorial, you will learn about the following HTML quotation and citation elements:

- `<blockquote>`: Block quotation
- `<q>`: Inline quotation
- `<cite>`: Citation
- `<abbr>`: Abbreviation
- `<address>`: Contact information

## HTML Block Quotation

HTML block quotation is defined with the `<blockquote>` tag. The `<blockquote>` tag is used to define a block of text that is quoted from another source. It is typically displayed with indentation and a line break before and after the quoted text.

```html title="index.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Block Quotation Example</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
    <blockquote>
      This is a block quotation.
    </blockquote>
  </body>
</html>
```

<BrowserWindow url="http://.../index.html">
  <div>
    <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
    <blockquote>
      This is a block quotation.
    </blockquote>
  </div>
</BrowserWindow>

In the example above, the `<blockquote>` tag is used to define a block quotation with the text "This is a block quotation."

## HTML Inline Quotation

HTML inline quotation is defined with the `<q>` tag. The `<q>` tag is used to define a short inline quotation. It is typically displayed with quotation marks around the quoted text.

```html title="index.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Inline Quotation Example</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
    <p>This is an <q>inline</q> quotation.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

<BrowserWindow url="http://.../index.html">
  <div>
    <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
    <p>This is an <q>inline</q> quotation.</p>
  </div>
</BrowserWindow>

In the example above, the `<q>` tag is used to define an inline quotation with the text "inline."

## HTML Citation

HTML citation is defined with the `<cite>` tag. The `<cite>` tag is used to define the title of a work, such as a book, article, or other publication. It is typically displayed in italics.

```html title="index.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Citation Example</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
    <p>This is a <cite>citation</cite>.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

<BrowserWindow url="http://.../index.html">
  <div>
    <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
    <p>This is a <cite>citation</cite>.</p>
  </div>
</BrowserWindow>

In the example above, the `<cite>` tag is used to define a citation with the text "citation."

## HTML Abbreviation

HTML abbreviation is defined with the `<abbr>` tag. The `<abbr>` tag is used to define an abbreviation or acronym. It is typically displayed with a dotted underline and a tooltip that shows the full form of the abbreviation when the user hovers over it.

```html title="index.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Abbreviation Example</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
    <p>This is an <abbr title="abbreviation">abbr</abbr>.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

<BrowserWindow url="http://.../index.html">
  <div>
    <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
    <p>This is an <abbr title="abbreviation">abbr</abbr>.</p>
  </div>
</BrowserWindow>

In the example above, the `<abbr>` tag is used to define an abbreviation with the text "abbr." The `title` attribute is used to specify the full form of the abbreviation, which is displayed as a tooltip when the user hovers over the abbreviation.

## HTML Address

HTML address is defined with the `<address>` tag. The `<address>` tag is used to define contact information for the author or owner of a document. It is typically displayed in italics.

```html title="index.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Address Example</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
    <address>
      Written by John Doe.<br>
      Visit us at:<br>
      Example.com
    </address>
  </body>
</html>
```

<BrowserWindow url="http://.../index.html">
  <div>
    <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
    <address>
      Written by John Doe.<br />
      Visit us at:<br />
      Example.com
    </address>
  </div>
</BrowserWindow>

In the example above, the `<address>` tag is used to define contact information with the text "Written by John Doe." and "Visit us at: Example.com."

# üôãüèª HTML Block and inline Elements

HTML elements can be classified into two main categories: block-level elements and inline elements. Understanding the difference between these two types of elements is essential for creating well-structured and visually appealing web pages.

## Block-Level Elements

Block-level elements are HTML elements that create a block of content on a web page. These elements typically start on a new line and take up the full width of their container. Block-level elements can contain other block-level elements or inline elements.

Here are some common block-level elements:

- `<div>`: Defines a division or section of content.
- `<p>`: Defines a paragraph of text.
- `<h1>` to `<h6>`: Defines headings of different levels.
- `<ul>`: Defines an unordered list.
- `<ol>`: Defines an ordered list.
- `<li>`: Defines a list item.
- `<table>`: Defines a table.
- `<form>`: Defines a form.

Block-level elements are often used to structure the layout of a web page and create distinct sections of content. They can be styled using CSS to control their appearance, such as setting the background color, margin, padding, and border.

## Inline Elements

Inline elements are HTML elements that do not create a new line and only take up as much width as necessary. These elements are typically used within block-level elements to style or format text or other content.

Here are some common inline elements:

- `<span>`: Defines a span of text.
- `<a>`: Defines a hyperlink.
- `<strong>`: Defines text with strong importance.
- `<em>`: Defines text with emphasis.
- `<img>`: Defines an image.
- `<input>`: Defines an input field.

Inline elements are often used to apply styles to specific parts of the content, such as changing the font color, size, or style. They can be styled using CSS to control their appearance, such as setting the text color, font size, and text decoration.

## Difference Between Block-Level and Inline Elements

|No. | Block-Level Elements | Inline Elements |

## Combining Block and Inline Elements

In practice, web developers often combine block-level and inline elements to create complex layouts and designs. By using a combination of block-level and inline elements, you can achieve a wide range of visual effects and structures on a web page.

For example, you can use block-level elements to create sections of content with distinct styles and layouts, while using inline elements to apply styles to specific parts of the content, such as links, text formatting, or images.

Understanding the difference between block-level and inline elements and how to use them effectively is key to creating well-structured and visually appealing web pages. By mastering the use of block and inline elements, you can create web pages that are both functional and aesthetically pleasing.

## Summary

Block-level elements create a block of content on a web page and start on a new line, taking up the full width of their container. Inline elements do not create a new line and only take up as much width as necessary. By combining block-level and inline elements, you can create visually appealing and well-structured web pages.

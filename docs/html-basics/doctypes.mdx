# üôãüèª Basic HTML Doctype

A **DOCTYPE** declaration is an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in. It is not an HTML tag, but an instruction to the web browser about the version of HTML the page is written in.

The **DOCTYPE** declaration is not case-sensitive. The **DOCTYPE** declaration for HTML5 is `<!DOCTYPE html>`.

The **DOCTYPE** declaration must be the very first thing in your HTML document, before the `<html>` tag.

Here is an example of a **DOCTYPE** declaration for HTML5:

```html title="index.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

<BrowserWindow url="http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html">
    <div>
        <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
        <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    </div>
</BrowserWindow>

In the example above, the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration is the **DOCTYPE** declaration for HTML5. The `<html>` tag is the root element of the HTML document. The `<head>` element contains meta-information about the document, such as its title. The `<title>` element specifies a title for the document. The `<body>` element contains the visible page content. The `<h1>` element defines a large heading. The `<p>` element defines a paragraph.

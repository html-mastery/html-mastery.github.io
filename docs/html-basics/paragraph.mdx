# 🙋🏻 HTML Paragraph

HTML paragraphs are defined with the `<p>` tag. The `<p>` tag defines a paragraph of text. It is used to group a block of text together.

```html title="index.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Paragraph Example</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    <p>This is another paragraph.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

<BrowserWindow url="http://.../index.html">
  <div>
    <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    <p>This is another paragraph.</p>
  </div>
</BrowserWindow>

In the example above, the `<p>` tag defines two paragraphs of text. The first paragraph contains the text "This is a paragraph." The second paragraph contains the text "This is another paragraph."
